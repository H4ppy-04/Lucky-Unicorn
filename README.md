# Luck Unicorn


## History

This is a game that was made a very long time ago.  I went back to visit it,
and improved the code a little.  I decided that even though it's not my best
work, I should publish it anyway. Perhaps someone can learn from the code.


## How to Play

Playing the game itself is actually quite simple. You get a starting balance of
`20$`. You have a 1/3 change of getting a prize. When you're finished, your
progress is saved, do don't worry about having to restart from scratch.
