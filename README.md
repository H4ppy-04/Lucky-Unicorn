# Lucky Unicorn


## History

This is a game that was made a very long time ago.  I went back to visit it,
and improved the code a little.  I decided that even though it's not my best
work, I should publish it anyway. Perhaps someone can learn from the code.

## Install

### Clone the repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/H4ppy-04/Lucky-Unicorn; cd Lucky-Unicorn;
```
### Create a virtual environment
```bash
python -m venv venv; source ./venv/bin/activate;
```

### Install dependencies
```bash
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt;
```

### Play the game
```bash
python lucky-unicorn
```

## How to Play

Playing the game itself is actually quite simple. You get a starting balance of
`20$`. You have a 1/3 change of getting a prize. When you're finished, your
progress is saved, do don't worry about having to restart from scratch.
